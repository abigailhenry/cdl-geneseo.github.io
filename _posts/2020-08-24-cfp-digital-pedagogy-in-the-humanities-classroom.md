The [SUNY Center for Professional Development](https://cpd.suny.edu), together with the [Office of Library and Information Services](https://system.suny.edu/olis/) and [SUNY Press](http://www.sunypress.edu/), has issued a call for interest in ["Digital Pedagogy in the Humanities Classroom,"](https://sunycpd.eventsair.com/QuickEventWebsitePortal/dphc20/dphc) a series of online events and workshops designed to help create a community of practice and support research on humanities-focused digital pedagogy within SUNY.

The series will kick off with an online gathering September 25 at which humanities faculty can showcase what they and their students are doing with digital tools and methods that aim to "make learning more inclusive, participatory, collaborative, transparent, and active."

Here's a link to [the proposal form for the September 25 showcase event](https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/SUNYHumanities).

And here's the full text of the CFP:

> What role does digital pedagogy play in humanities teaching? Across academia, humanities faculty have been experimenting with innovative uses of digital technology that make learning more inclusive, participatory, collaborative, transparent, and active. Students in humanities disciplines are annotating websites, contributing to public-facing digital archives, analyzing texts through computation, encoding digitized documents, engaging in multimedia storytelling, sharing knowledge and self-reflection through blogs and podcasts, and visualizing humanities data in maps, timelines, and network graphs.
>
> The SUNY Office of Library and Information Services, SUNY Center for Professional Development and SUNY Press are organizing an online gathering Friday, September 25, 2020 from 1:00 - 2:30 pm to showcase digital pedagogy in the humanities at SUNY. The gathering will be organized as a series of short (5-10 minute) presentations by SUNY faculty highlighting one course activity that utilizes digital pedagogy.
>
> This kick-off event will be followed by a series of online events and workshops designed to create a community of practice within SUNY focused on how to best utilize digital pedagogy to help students achieve learning goals. The community of practice will help newcomers to digital pedagogy get started and provide opportunities for more experienced practitioners to acquire new skills, tools, and ideas. Another goal of the community of practice is to support research about digital pedagogy that faculty can use across the spectrum of learning situations, from fully physical to hybrid to fully remote instruction.
