<span class="drop">I</span>t's time for another CDL newsletter! This month's newsletter falls within Black History Month, which will be the CDL's primary focus for the duration of the month. 

This month, you can expect the CDL to be promoting the many Black History Month events planned and organized by the Antiracism and DEI subcommittee of the Presidentâ€™s Commission on Diversity and Community at Geneseo. 

You'll find an image of our newsletter at the bottom of this post, which reads:

>February 2021 marks a particularly significant Black History Month following the simultaneously harrowing and hopeful events of 2020. As Amanda Gorman in her Inaugural Poem affirmed,
    
    "Somehow we've weathered and witnessed
    a nation that isn't broken,
    but simply unfinished."
                "The Hill We Climb" (2021)

>As part of the unfinished work ahead, Geneseo will be hosting events this February designed to celebrate Black history, investigate the social structures that perpetuate racial injustice, and advance the college's goal of becoming an antiracist campus.

>One of these events will be a week-long screening of the film Coded Bias, which follows MIT researcher Joy Buolamwini as she explores the bias built into certain types of software. Join the CDL for a conversation with the film's director, Shalini Kantayya, **February 18 at 2:30 p.m.**

>We'll be too busy attending all the other great BHM events to host any workshops this month. Hope 
to see you at some of them! For full event details go to the [Geneseo Events Calendar](https://events.geneseo.edu/black_history_month).
