<span class="drop">I</span>n response to our [Conversation on Student Workload in Online Courses](https://cdl-geneseo.github.io/news/2021/03/11/a-community-conversation-on-student-workload-in-online-courses/), the CDL [made a commitment](/2021-04-09-burned-out-and-bewildered.md/#where-we-go) to provide the Geneseo student community with easily-consumable workshops and resources to make the remainder of their (hopefully) last semester of pandemic online learning even a little more mangageable. 

Lucky for the CDL, we have productivity expert extraordinaire, [CIT](https://www.geneseo.edu/cit)'s Director for Education Technology and the [CDL](https://www.geneseo.edu/cdl)'s Assistant Director for Online Learning, Laurie Fox to run micro-workshops on efficiently managing all sorts of obligations in the form of to-do lists.

## Up next!

This Wednesday (04/21/2021) the CDL will be featuring Laurie Fox yet again to expand on this micro-workshop and into a session on to-do lists! Laurie's "Make your to-do list work for you" will cover 4 key to-do list tips:

1. Collect everything
2. Review routinely
3. Break things into smaller bites (how do you eat an elephantâ€¦)
4. Eat the Frog (do the hardest thing every day)

If you can make it, great! If you just can't find the time, that's ok, too. We'll be sharing the video just like this last one!

Remember, we at the CDL (and many other departments!) are here to help, and we believe in you! :star2:
