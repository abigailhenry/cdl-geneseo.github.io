<span class="drop">F</span>or our final micro-workshop of this semester, the CDL hosted "Dear Professor: crafting the perfect email to your professor" presented by Paul Schacht. Finals are almost upon us, and students may find themselves even more overwhelmed than they have been all semester during the pandemic. Dr. Schacht shares encouraging and helpful tips, from a professor's perspective, for how students can respectfully and effectively reach out to their professors for extensions on assignments or to request to take an exam on a later date. And, while the professor's perspective is a great thing to have when considering how to email them, the CDL was thrilled to include the perspective of one of our Student Affiliates, [Emma Raupp](https://cdl-geneseo.github.io/authors/raupp/), on this topic as well. Emma shares her own experience with reaching out to professors and reassures students facing common worries.

From crafting the perfect subject line that will catch your professor's attention to appreciating the humanity that exists between the two of you when communicating your needs, this session will definitely make you feel more confident about advocating for yourself as a student. Check out the recording below!
