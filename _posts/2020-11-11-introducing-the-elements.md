Next week, The Center for Digital Learning kicks off a series of workshops called **&lt;the&nbsp;elements&nbsp;/&gt;**. As the name suggests, it's a series focused on elemental computing skills — skills that increase your power and autonomy as a scholar, creator, or citizen.

Knowing how to communicate with our computers in this elemental way is the first step toward learning how to do the sorts of things that many of us, increasingly, find necessary to our research &mdash; such as scraping the web for statistical data or textual content we'd like to analyze.

Even more important, perhaps, it's the first step toward ending our reliance on the pretty wrapper that Apple or Microsoft has put around our computers' operating systems — a wrapper that simplifies the computing experience at the cost of obscuring how our computers actually do their work.

Who is this workshop for? *You* — no matter what your current skill-level. We'll take it slow!

The workshop is limited to 30 participants. To register, go to: <https://bit.ly/3nedRlf>

We're looking forward to seeing you on the command line!
