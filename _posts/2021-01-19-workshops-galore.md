## Command-Line Part II

This one-hour workshop is a continuation of our last workshop, and will teach you how to run a number of basic but powerful computer programs using simple, text-based commands. Knowing how to communicate with your computer in this elemental way will empower you to explore new directions in your scholarly and creative projects. This workshop will be presented by Paul Schacht, Director of the CDL, with assistance from yours truly.

Even if you didn't make it to Part I you should find this session accessible, as we'll be working through the same modules we covered in the first workshop. We hope to see you there!
