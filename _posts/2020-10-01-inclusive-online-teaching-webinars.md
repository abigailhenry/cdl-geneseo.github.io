<span class="drop">T</span>he Association of College and University Educators is providing a timely and constructive webinar series that focuses on ["Effective Online Instruction"](https://acue.org/webinars/inclusive-online-teaching/) through "Inclusive Online Teaching". These webinars, featuring leading faculty experts in digital equity, are free, live, run for approximately 1 hour, and will include Q&A for participants at the end of each session. The Center for Digital Learning and the Teaching and Learning Center at Geneseo encourage any and all who are interested in attending this event to register with the ACUE.

The webinars are available as follows:

**Creating an Inclusive Online Learning Environment:** Friday, October 2, 2020, 3:00pm ET — [Register for this session](https://zoom.us/webinar/register/7116004382343/WN_DIyz9X-YSI6Cnn4RxX_4Xw)

**Preparing an Inclusive Online Course:** Friday, October 9, 2020, 12:00pm ET — [Register for this session](https://zoom.us/webinar/register/9316007883337/WN_JvXEdvwOS8OZOgdjW1fzAA)

Following these webinars, the CDL and TLC aim to host follow-up discussions based on the preceding session to consider how SUNY Geneseo might be able to engage with the principles and practices covered by presenters in our own campus context. We see this as a great way to start our center's important work to promote conversation around digital learning at Geneseo, and hope to "see" you there!
