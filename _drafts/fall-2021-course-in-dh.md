Here's the full course description:

> Digital technologies are reshaping scholarship in fields across the humanities from literature to music to history. In this course, we will explore the perspectives of scholars who have thought about what "digital humanities" means and the technologies and tools being used to shape research, scholarship, and publishing, with a particular focus on the discipline of History. Topics will include the history of the digital humanities, textual studies, computational and new media, and emerging workaround text, image, and new media curation and visualization. The final two weeks of the course will be dedicated to the study of the field of Digital Humanities in a non-Eurocentric setting and with a non-Latin script, in this case, Arabic script and the History of the Islamic world. Active engagement by all participants is expected. Students will contribute to the field with a creative final project that they develop over the course of the semester.

If you have questions about the course, don't hesitate to email Dr. Anssari: `mansari@geneseo.edu`.
