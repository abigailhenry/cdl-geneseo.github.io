# POST BLOG DRAFTS HERE

Student affiliates will use this folder to post their midterm and final, or, "milestone," blog posts. This folder will not appear on the CDL blog site, but, rather, will stay on the master repository page until they are ready to be "published." 

In order to push to this folder, you will have to open a pull request from your fork of this repository. Dr. Schacht or Amanda will accept the request, and from there, we will work with you on any necessary adjustments prior to approving your ultimate `git mv` to the `_posts` folder.
