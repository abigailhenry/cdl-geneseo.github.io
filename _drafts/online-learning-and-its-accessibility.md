# Online learning, and its accessibility in these unprecedented times

With most universities across the nation transitioning either fully or partly to online learning due to the COVID-19 pandemic, college students’ accessibility issues have been highlighted and accentuated more than ever. While online learning certainly has it pros, such as keeping everyone’s physical health a priority in these unprecedented times, it is important to acknowledge the potential cons that come along with it.

Before we start to unpack the more complex, intricate obstacles current students are being forced to overcome, we need to consider the accessibility of college as a whole, from an economic and social status standpoint. Higher education is very much still considered a privilege, meaning that the people who want to pursue it can only do so if they have the necessary financial means. Even then, it is common for individuals to need to take out student loans in order to attend college. Speaking from personal experience, by the time I finish my bachelor’s degree, I will be tens of thousands of dollars in debt - despite having received the maximum amount of financial aid available and earning multiple scholarships. Not to mention, the costs that are not directly included in tuition, such as textbooks and other required materials, can be unfeasible for some. Almost all universities today require students to have personal computers, which can easily have a price of an upwards of a thousand dollars. And, with the ongoing switch to online learning because of COVID-19, there is no way of avoiding this cost. If students are fully remote, too, there comes the hefty price tag of internet access - especially since most public places that offer free Wi-Fi are closed for the foreseeable future. As the article [“Colleges flock to online proctors, but equity concerns remain”](https://files.zotero.net/eyJleHBpcmVzIjoxNjAzNTY5NDE4LCJoYXNoIjoiMzQzZTgyMmQwYTM1ZWNmMWJjMzJhMGYwZTllZGUyMTgiLCJjb250ZW50VHlwZSI6InRleHRcL2h0bWwiLCJjaGFyc2V0IjoidXRmLTgiLCJ6aXAiOjF9/ee63d00f83233235d478cff036510ef433b87b57c8e18a263031cea6c8ab605e/575642.html) states,

> “Although most learners have laptops, a survey of 748 students found about one in five struggled to use the technology at their disposal because of issues such as broken hardware and connectivity problems. Students of color or lower socioeconomic status encountered these difficulties more often.” (Schwartz 2020)

This pandemic has been affecting everyone differently, and we need to recognize the gravity of it effects. A lot of people have lost their jobs, making it more difficult once again to pay these prices; not everyone can afford them. While colleges cannot get rid of the laptop requirement, there may be some other changes that can be made. For example, instead of teaching synchronous courses with live video meetings, perhaps a professor can opt instead to offer an asynchronous version of their course with class discussion boards. Not only would this allow the course to be more flexible in students' schedules, but would also eliminate students' worry of a Zoom call suddenly dropping, not having consistent 24/7 access to Wi-Fi, or of not having a quiet space to attend the meeting in.

*This is only half of my post and it needs revision! I wrote all of this out, and while I like it, I think it’s sidetracked a bit from my topic.*
