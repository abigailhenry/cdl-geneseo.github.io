You can create a post by copying this file and substituting the correct information in the YAML header at the top. Be sure to retain the three dashes (---) above and below!

Save file with format yyyy-mm-dd-your-post-title.md 

No spaces in filenames and no punctuation other than hyphens and the period before the file extension!

The title and date you enter in the YAML header above will display as your post title and date when the post is published. The author name will display as well and, if you have a bio page, will link to it.
