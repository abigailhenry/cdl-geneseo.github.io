The Center for Digital Learning, the Department of Computing and Information Technology, the Office of the Provost, and faculty in the Department of Communication have collaborated to launch a competition for the most uplifting tales of living and learning at Geneseo this fall under the shadow of Covid-19.

2020 has been tough on all of us. But in spite of the difficulties, the Geneseo community has remained resilient and strong. We’ve found creative ways to stay active and connected and to enjoy being on campus while still respecting the restrictions necessary to keep everyone healthy and safe.

We want to know how you’ve done it! We’re asking you to share a short clip that represents how you’ve found one or more sources of joy, inspiration, humor, hope, solidarity, or gratitude in these challenging circumstances. We’re hoping that these clips will not only demonstrate Geneseo students’ collective resilience but also provide hope and cheer — and maybe even a few good ideas — to those in our community who’ve been struggling.

Clips (either audio or video) should be about 30 seconds long and imaginatively capture whatever it is that’s been a bright spot in your 2020 experience. The most inspirational clips will be named finalists by a team of faculty and staff, and they'll be featured on the Geneseo website. The whole campus community will be invited to vote on favorites, and those voted the *very* best by a Geneseo wide survey will win prizes. Finalists are eligible for prizes, including gift cards and Geneseo swag.

Clips should be submitted to this Ensemble Dropbox before December 7. Audio clips must be submitted as .mp3 files. Video clips must be in .mov or .mp4/.m4v file formats. We’ve assembled some stock footage of Geneseo events for those prevented by social distancing or other obstacles from shooting their own video. (And even if you do shoot your own, you’re welcome to combine this with it.)

Finalists will be notified and their work placed on line for viewing and voting by December 11, by Geneseo’s Communications and Marketing team. 

All clips should consist of original work to which you own the intellectual rights. Any music not created by the participating team must be legally licensed through a site such as Creative Commons with proper attribution supplied. By submitting, you agree to the use of your work on the Geneseo website and social media, and you should ensure anyone whose image or words you include agrees to that use. See Geneseo’s photo release form.
