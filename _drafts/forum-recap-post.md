<span class="drop">T</span>he Student Association and Center for Digital Learning co-sponsored event held on March 18, 2021 has given all involved a lot to think about regarding the student experience during the pandemic, particularly as it relates to workload in their online courses. 

We invited students, staff, and faculty to join in a candid conversation with each other about their experiences with and perspectives on student workload during remote instruction after consistently hearing through social media based in Geneseo, and beyond, about how burdened students feel. Simultaneously, we would also hear about how hard some faculty are working to meet student needs and limitations while handling their own challenges, as well as how some things that currently frustrate students might be out of their hands. Furthermore, we've been hearing more from our students about how *talking isn't enough* when trying to solve issues that are impacting the mental, emotional, and, thereby, academic health of students, and that action needs to be taken. Soon.

With that in mind, we set out to design a session for students to share their feelings and experiences in a wholly unintimidating environment while inviting faculty and staff to attend and share as well, but mostly to listen. But listening was only part of what we wanted to provide students with as a result of this time together; we listened with with open hearts and intent to act.

Realistically, the CDL can't affect institutional change; we're not administration. But we *do* want to help students where they're at *now*, hopefully in time to get them through the rest of what we anticipate to be their last semester of emergency pandemic learning. Fortunately, there are a few ways our center can do that, which we're currently exploring and actively planning, and will detail later in this post.

Our time together on March 18th was structured into three distinct parts: 

## An anonymous, collaborative slide deck
 
Facilitators provided a blank slide deck in Google slides asking "How are you feeling?" Sharing permissions were set so that participants could add their thoughts anonymously.

Read through the slides below:


This session made clear a few expected, and unexpected, realities for both students and faculty.

### Students: Missing friends... and breaks.

Covid has taken a toll on everyone's social life, but for college students it's extra impactful. Students shared that the precautions Geneseo and most universities have had to take to protect their campuses during this pandemic has exacerbated feelings of loneliness and isolation. Furthermore, students point out that excessive Zoom meetings as well as almost constant screen-time have made it difficult to leave their rooms during the day and socialize in person even to the extent to which they are permitted during Covid.

Additionally, while the college has implemented "rejuvenation days" in lieu of conventional Thanksgiving or Spring breaks for students, and faculty, to rest, students don't feel like they get that opportunity, as many are saddled with due dates immediately following rejuvenation days. Students miss having an extended period of time to not think about their work and recharge. The same screen-time that keeps students from socializing with those in their bubbles is also a constant exposure to their work as they find themselves going from Zoom call to discussion boards to assignments in one continuous flow.

Some students zero in on one task in particular that overloads their to-do lists: overreliance on discussion boards. Many students feel that requiring lengthy discussion board responses overlooks the time-consuming reality of that work. One student expresses: 

> I have noticed for my hybrid “in person” classes when I share within a conversation I am **energized** by the discussion. Virtually discussing (particularly canvas discussion boards) where I have to write responses leave me feeling **exhausted**. Especially since I am writing 400-500 word responses for multiple discussion boards over 4 courses multiple times a week. *(Slide 21)*

All-in-all, students are feeling run-down and overburdened, and don't know how to overcome this situation.

### Students: Feeling lost and lacking structure

According to what students shared in these slides, a good deal of their anxiety is coming from feeling "lost" in their courses. Some students describe this as constantly worrying whether or not they're missing a deadline or not being able to locate the relevant materials instructors have shared in Canvas. Hand-in-hand with this issue is the fact that some students are struggling with either not understanding their Canvas course structure or those courses having a general lack thereof. 

Furthermore, there are students who express that a structured lecture time would relieve the pressure of gathering information and "teaching" it to themselves rather than having the guidance of either a synchronous lecture or carefully crafted modules that purposefully present information. While video lectures can help, some students struggle to find time to watch those lectures on top of their other assignments.

The concerns brought up under this theme have a common quality: **organization**, both at the student and faculty level. Pandemic teaching and learning has asked both of these groups to change they way they structure their work and, for faculty, communicate that structure simultaneously. As if this weren't difficult enough, in remote classes neither of these parties can see the other in order to build empathetic, genuine relationships.
