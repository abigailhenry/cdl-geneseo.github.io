### Students: Missing friends... and breaks.

Covid has taken a toll on everyone's social life, but for college students it's extra impactful. Students shared that the precautions Geneseo and most universities have had to take to protect their campuses during this pandemic has exacerbated feelings of loneliness and isolation. Furthermore, students point out that excessive Zoom meetings have made it difficult to leave their rooms during the day and socialize in person to the extent to which they are permitted during Covid.
