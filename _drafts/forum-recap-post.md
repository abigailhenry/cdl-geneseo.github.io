*Students, faculty, and staff are finding it harder to keep everything together during the pandemic.*{:.image-caption}

<span class="drop">T</span>he Student Association and Center for Digital Learning co-sponsored event held on March 18, 2021 has given all involved a lot to think about regarding the student experience during the pandemic, particularly as it relates to workload in their online courses. 

We invited students, staff, and faculty to join in a candid conversation with each other about their experiences with and perspectives on student workload during remote instruction after consistently hearing through social media based in Geneseo, and beyond, about how burdened students feel. Simultaneously, we would also hear about how hard some faculty are working to meet student needs and limitations while handling their own challenges, as well as how some things that currently frustrate students might be out of their hands. Furthermore, we've been hearing more from our students about how *talking isn't enough* when trying to solve issues that are impacting the mental, emotional, and, thereby, academic health of students, and that action needs to be taken. Soon.

With that in mind, we set out to design a session for students to share their feelings and experiences in a wholly unintimidating environment while inviting faculty and staff to attend and share as well, but mostly to listen. But listening was only part of what we wanted to provide students with as a result of this time together; we listened with with open hearts and intent to act.

Realistically, the CDL can't affect institutional change; we're not administration. But we *do* want to help students where they're at *now*, hopefully in time to get them through the rest of what we anticipate to be their last semester of emergency pandemic learning. Fortunately, there are a few ways our center can do that, which we're currently exploring and actively planning, and will detail later in this post.

Our time together on March 18th was structured into three distinct parts: 

1. [An anonymous, collaborative slide deck](#slide-deck)
1. [Annotating Jody Greene's "The Strange Case of the Exploding Student Workload"](#strange-case)
1. [Breakout rooms with discussion questions and a collaborative note-taking document](#breakout-rooms)

<h2 id="slide-deck">An anonymous, collaborative slide deck</h2>
 
Facilitators provided a blank slide deck in Google slides asking "How are you feeling?" Sharing permissions were set so that participants could add their thoughts anonymously.

This session made clear a few expected, and unexpected, realities for both students and faculty.

### Students: Missing friends... and breaks.

Covid has taken a toll on everyone's social life, but for college students it's extra impactful. Students shared that the precautions Geneseo and most universities have had to take to protect their campuses during this pandemic has exacerbated feelings of loneliness and isolation. Furthermore, students point out that excessive Zoom meetings as well as almost constant screen-time have made it difficult to leave their rooms during the day and socialize in person even to the extent to which they are permitted during Covid.

Additionally, while the college has implemented "rejuvenation days" in lieu of conventional Thanksgiving or Spring breaks for students, and faculty, to rest, students don't feel like they get that opportunity, as many are saddled with due dates immediately following rejuvenation days. Students miss having an extended period of time to not think about their work and recharge. The same screen-time that keeps students from socializing with those in their bubbles is also a constant exposure to their work as they find themselves going from Zoom call to discussion boards to assignments in one continuous flow.

Some students zero in on one task in particular that overloads their to-do lists: overreliance on discussion boards. Many students feel that requiring lengthy discussion board responses overlooks the time-consuming reality of that work. One student expresses: 

> I have noticed for my hybrid “in person” classes when I share within a conversation I am **energized** by the discussion. Virtually discussing (particularly canvas discussion boards) where I have to write responses leave me feeling **exhausted**. Especially since I am writing 400-500 word responses for multiple discussion boards over 4 courses multiple times a week. *(Slide 21)*

All-in-all, students are feeling run-down and overburdened, and don't know how to overcome this situation.

### Students: Feeling lost and lacking structure

According to what students shared in these slides, a good deal of their anxiety is coming from feeling "lost" in their courses. Some students describe this as constantly worrying whether or not they're missing a deadline or not being able to locate the relevant materials instructors have shared in Canvas. Hand-in-hand with this issue is the fact that some students are struggling with either not understanding their Canvas course structure or those courses having a general lack thereof. 

Furthermore, there are students who express that a structured lecture time would relieve the pressure of gathering information and "teaching" it to themselves rather than having the guidance of either a synchronous lecture or carefully crafted modules that purposefully present information. While video lectures can help, some students struggle to find time to watch those lectures on top of their other assignments.

The concerns brought up under this theme have a common quality: **organization**, both at the student and faculty level. Pandemic teaching and learning has asked both of these groups to change they way they structure their work and, for faculty, communicate that structure simultaneously. As if this weren't difficult enough, in remote classes neither of these parties can actually be in the same physical presence as the other person in order to build empathetic, genuine relationships.

### Faculty: Feeling constrained and in-the-dark

While we didn't get a lot of faculty feedback in this session, as it was primarily aimed at student experiences, we did get some. That feedback included a general feeling of working with students in a highly constrained and obscured way; an extension of this lack of connection discussed earlier. 

Faculty share that they miss out on tailoring their class time and instruction to their students' unique interests and personalities, as many faculty maintain that each class has a different overall "self", when engaging in remote teaching. They also share that they are constrained in the way they can communicate with students be it via Canvas, email, or an inability to do either in such cases as when a student misses a COVID test and are locked out of their accounts and classes (Slide 15).

This faculty perspective is invaluable to our understanding of the overall picture of student workload and the current student experience, and we appreciate those who were willing to share with us during this session.

<h2 id="strange-case">Annotating Jody Greene's "The Strange Case of the Exploding Student Workload"</h2>

### The article

This portion of our session was dedicated to a live-annotation of [Jody Greene's](https://www.insidehighered.com/blogs/just-visiting/guest-post-strange-case-exploding-student-workload) article featured in *Inside Higher Ed* last December. 

### The task

We placed Greene's article in four private Google docs shared only with the participants and asked them to use the highlight and comments functions to dissect the issues and ideas brought up in the article and respond to one another's observations. The article was copied into four different Docs in order to keep one document from getting overwhelmed by comments.

### The results

While the article is relatively brief, it took some time for folks to read through it if they hadn't had the opportunity to read it when we sent it out ahead of time. Then, slowly but surely, we started to see lots of highlighting and comments. Here are some of the most striking points our participants drew out of the article:

> F(aculty): I have opted to eliminate many of my typical assignments from all of my classes in order to streamline them ... and hopefully make them more manageable.
    >> S(tudent): I think that this would be more than beneficial to students. Spending time on assignments has taken away from my understanding of the class as a whole. I find myself focusing more on getting the assignment done than grasping the material.

> F: I was not prepared to have students email me that they had lost a loved one to covid and wanting to still push through and get through the course. Math seems irrelevant at that point.

> F: One of the struggles that needs to be addressed both from a workload and a mental health aspect is the opportunity to fail. Failure is no longer defined as poor participation or contributions to class - it is not feeling comfortable approaching online professors for help and disappearing.
    >> S: This is true! I feel that the lack of face-to-face connection with professors makes it so much harder to feel comfortable talking one-on-one.

> S: How to grade class participation seems to have definitely been a struggle for a lot of my professors. There is a large energy difference between commenting in person in a class and writing discussion board posts and replies. These small assignments take a lot of energy when multiplied over 3-4 courses. They are typically worth very little in terms of grading.

> S: Something that's helped in a couple of my courses is to make it so that students are able to "skip" 2-3 assignments in a particular category (discussion posts, reading responses, etc.) so that students can opt out of an assignment if they're having a tough day/week, if needed, but only a few times per semester

> F: Pandemic teaching has also taught us the importance of always practicing universal design.
    >> S: As a student, this really speaks to me. I feel like there is a strong need for universal design in terms of presenting information.

We appreciated how this exercise took away the anonymity provided in the last activity, where more personal feelings were being discussed, and allowed students and faculty looking at this article to communicate directly with each other. Were thrilled to see both parties taking advantage of the opportunity, especially as students actively engaged in responding to specific faculty comments.


<h2 id="breakout-rooms">Breakout rooms with discussion questions and a collaborative note-taking document</h2>

Our last activity of the session was to send the attendees into breakout rooms in Zoom to address a set of [discussion questions](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1L_P5XukB-Qxe4sHZmx8JHypMXKjREfn3tNechsxlUVE/edit?usp=sharing). Each breakout room was intentionally structured to include multiple students to each faculty or staff members. This structure was important to us because not only did we want to amplify student voices by providing them greater representation, but we also didn't want any students to feel intimidated by being the only student in a room of faculty/staff. Not surprisingly, many students dropped off the call either once we announced at the beginning of the session that we would eventually be doing breakout rooms or once the breakout rooms actually began, so, unfortunately, this plan kind of fell through, and our ratio was skewed more heavily toward the faculty/staff side. 

Regardless, we did have designated notetakers for each group that added to a collaborative [Google doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/19P71sz-X6Meuod-vPaeRfzqKD_e2e2NRZP16JgLF4Bw/edit?usp=sharing) so that everyone could see how each group addressed their assigned question. While each group was assigned a single question, we ended up with one extra question originally intended for Group 3, but was orphaned after we lost enough participants to leave Group 3 empty. So, you'll notice that we invited groups to address Group 3's question if they had time after discussing their assigned question.

Reading through this collaborative document, you'll find a common theme: students asking for clarity. This ask is a clear extension of the desire for organization and structure expressed earlier in the previous session activities. Students are concerned about not understanding their professors' expectations from the get-go. While it may seem like the answer to this concern would be to reach out to these professors, that may be a substantial barrier for students, and might not result in a prompt reply depending on the circumstances, thereby leaving students to rely solely on their assumptions.

## Where we go from here

It's no secret that we're approaching the end of this semester, which will, hopefully, be our last semester of pandemic-required online instruction and learning. That being said, we're clearly running out of time to help students where they're at *now*. However, we do have some tricks up our sleeves to guide students to a successful end-of-semester and future experiences with both online and in-person learning.

### Micro workshops for student success

Students are short on time, but they need tools to add to their toolboxes to get them through this semester, as well as those in the future. So, our team thought that the best thing we could do for students was to create short, 30-minute workshops for students on resources and practices that could help them now.

To be clear, we are not creating these workshops as a way of telling students to "pull themselves up by their bootstraps," so to speak, but to help them salvage whatever academic situation they may find themselves in during this pandemic. Since our center is *not* considered part of Geneseo's administration, we have no feasible way of implementing complex, last-minute policy, which would be difficult even if we were administration. Rather, we want to offer our services as a *service center*, meaning in ways that help students students and faculty use tools they can already access to be successful.

Some ideas for these workshops include teaching students how to leverage Gmail for maximum efficiency, especially when their professors rely heavily on email communication for their online instruction, as well as how to craft the perfect email to request flexibility on a deadline when something happens that impedes your work. We hope to bring these and more "micro workshops" to students before the end of the semester!

### The Zoom-free option: resource and experience sharing via the CDL blog

For those who are burnt out on Zoom to the point where even one more half hour popping into a Zoom room is simply not an option, we will be aggregating helpful resources on the topics covered in our micro workshops and highlighting the experiences of fellow students, their pandemic learning struggles, and how they are handling them to be shared on our [blog](https://cdl-geneseo.github.io/), so be sure to keep an eye on it!

## The future of online learning at Geneseo

Ultimately, it's our, and everyone's, hope that this will be the last pandemic learning experience for a long time.

The being said, even when pandemic learning and instruction is over, the effects of this experience will be long-lasting in various ways. One of the most exciting effects, perhaps ironically, in this context, is this very newfound embrace of online learning at traditionally in-person exclusive schools like Geneseo. This was not something that Geneseo prioritized in its strategic plan up to this point, but now that that seal has been broken, so to speak, there is no going back, only forward.

The CDL is thrilled to support instructors who are interested in continuing to teach online in Fall '21 through an experience currently being developed by Geneseo's talented team of [Instructional Designers](https://www.geneseo.edu/cit/instructional-design) we're calling the Online Teaching Institute (OTI). Instructors who go through this experience will be thoroughly familiarized with online teaching standards and best practices, as well as Geneseo's high expectations regarding online instruction. Not only is this OTI being designed and developed by our amazing instructional design team, but it's also being carefully reviewed by various other departments at Geneseo, including the [Office of Accessibility Serivces](https://www.geneseo.edu/accessibility-office), us at the [CDL](https://www.geneseo.edu/cdl), and the [Office of the Provost](https://www.geneseo.edu/provost), all with a keen eye on instructor success and what learning outcomes will most benefit their future students' experiences.
